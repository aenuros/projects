Goals for the pig latin project:

1. take first consonant and move it to the end (success)
2. take consonant cluster and move it to the end (work in progress)
3. take entire sentence and apply pig latin to it
4. make database of words with their IPA to notate mismatch between pronunciation/spelling

e.g

user input: "this is an herb"

check database (SQL?)

note that herb has two IPAS: Erb and herb

Ask user: "Which of these pronunciations is closer to you?
1. erb 2. herb"

If user uses 1. then herb is treated as 'erb', else it is treated as 'herb'.
This will only be used if there is an IPA that has different IPAs compared to the other
for the initial **consonant**. This is pretty rare other than words like 'herb'.

Creating an English word/IPA database may be useful for future programs as well.
